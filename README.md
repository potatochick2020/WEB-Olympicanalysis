Coursework requirement
Design your own webpage (starting from view.php), which allows a user to input a country ISO_id values and outputs:
1. the number of gold medals that the country won,
2. the country’s gold medal ranking amongst all the countries,
3. average BMI of their cyclists,
4. number of women cyclists (denoted by F in the database) of that country,
5. list of their cyclists’ names that participated in a “Cycling - Road” sport (this can be found inthe “sport” column of the Cyclist table).
You should only use the data from the MySQL database as well as the input data. This wouldpotentially obtain up to 40%.
You can be creative about how to present the requested information.
For extra marks, you could consider using AJAX and JSON to make your webpage more interactive(20% available for effective use of AJAX and JSON).
